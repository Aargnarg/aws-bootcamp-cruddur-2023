I did not work too much on this week as I could have and I know I will NEED to change that ASAP if I hope to get through this class and feel confident that I've learned the materials without feeling overly stressed. I've only finished the Week0 Credentials video which ran though setting up my AWS account (IAM too) with the proper policies for billing and budgeting. It also showed me how to set up the cli as well as gitpod and basically set the ground with the tools I will be using to build upon in the next weeks. 

It feels good to be back to coding in this manner, I graduated UCSC with a CS degree and we used bash for our projects so there are things that I recognize but everything AWS wise is brand new. I feel that my knowledge has prepared me though for what is to come and if I just give an hour or so every day I know this will definitely be like one of my "easier" classes since the teacher is very good at explaining concepts and setting us up. I am very excited and feel strong about this.
